      <description>Visual Studio Code is an Electron-based app with large community support. It was initially developed as a fork of Atom - an open-source code editor developed by GitHub. As it&amp;rsquo;s Electron-based, there is little overhead compared to other code editors like Sublime Text 3, Kate, or Notepad++. But its biggest strength is customizability. It supports a huge number of community developed plugins and themes. I will focus mostly on the ones used by me.</description>

      <description>As most of the programs that I am developing are CLI tools or servers, and they don&amp;rsquo;t feature any Graphical User Interface, I recently started my developing inside Docker containers. As I own some low power server, that is fast and stable enough to handle compiling software inside Docker, I decided that I will host this myself. In this miniseries, I will present how I created my setup, and I will explain why I did those things.</description>

      <description>Good to see you there! I am a student at the Silesian University of Technology, at the time of writing this post, I&amp;rsquo;m during my final (7th) semester of Electronic, Control, and Information Engineering major. Currently, I&amp;rsquo;m employed by Asseco Poland.
Interests? Many! Servers I love to work with the servers. My final thesis project is pluggabl - app for distributed image processing. I will share it&amp;rsquo;s code on GitHub when it&amp;rsquo;s finished, but until this moment, I can tell that it is using gRPC for Client / Server communication and it&amp;rsquo;s written in GoLang.</description>
