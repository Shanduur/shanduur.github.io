      <description>I never talked about the natural environment in public. But the educational value of this movie is that big that I can&amp;rsquo;t just watch it and pass by without sharing it with anyone. Maybe some of you already watched David Attenborough: A Life on Our Planet recently added to Netflix. It tells a story about the natural environment, which surrounds us, and on which we have a devastating impact. Sir David Attenborough is a legendary narrator, traveler, and popularizer of natural science in the whole world.</description>
