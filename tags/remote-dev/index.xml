      <description>Last part of mine remote development kit, is virtual software defined network. I don&amp;rsquo;t have access to public IP, so I couldn&amp;rsquo;t setup VPN. The solution was quite simple - virtual software defined network. My goal was to find something free or freemium and open source. Firstly I stumbled upon ZeroTier One and later I found Tailscale. Both seemed to fulfill my needs, so I will write something about both of them, although do not consider me as specialist - those will be only my thoughts on those pieces of software.</description>

      <title>My remote development tools (part 2) - Visual Studio Code</title>

      <description>Visual Studio Code is an Electron-based app with large community support. It was initially developed as a fork of Atom - an open-source code editor developed by GitHub. As it&amp;rsquo;s Electron-based, there is little overhead compared to other code editors like Sublime Text 3, Kate, or Notepad++. But its biggest strength is customizability. It supports a huge number of community developed plugins and themes. I will focus mostly on the ones used by me.</description>

      <title>My remote development tools (part 1) - Docker</title>

      <description>As most of the programs that I am developing are CLI tools or servers, and they don&amp;rsquo;t feature any Graphical User Interface, I recently started my developing inside Docker containers. As I own some low power server, that is fast and stable enough to handle compiling software inside Docker, I decided that I will host this myself. In this miniseries, I will present how I created my setup, and I will explain why I did those things.</description>
